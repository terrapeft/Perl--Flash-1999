      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> By Jessica Wallenfels<br>
      UltimateTV News<br>
      <img border="0" src="http://julie-bowen.virtualave.net/images/ghost.gif" width="430" height="1"> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> &nbsp;Bet you didn't 
        think anyone who majored in Italian Renaissance studies at Brown University 
        could end up starring on a mystery-spy-thriller TV show, replete with 
        guns, gadgets and high heels. That's Julie Bowen for you, a bundle of 
        contradictions who plays Amanda Webb on the WB's new &quot;Mod Squad&quot;-esque 
        &quot;Three.&quot; When asked about &quot;Three,&quot; Bowen describes: 
        &quot;It is about me wearing short shirts carrying big guns... oh, and 
        there are two other guys.&quot; </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As the calculating 
        Amanda, Bowen plays &quot;an orphaned man-hater who has decided to get 
        back at her past by taking advantage of men now...&quot; The government-employed 
        con-woman also does some mean karate. Amanda is a gearhead as well as 
        a drop-dead babe, lecturing authoritatively about &quot;fractal interpolator 
        conversations&quot; &quot;and sub-sonic mutilators.&quot; How does Bowen 
        take to the rigors of series-regular-dom? &quot;I'm a workaholic so doing 
        series work gives me a opportunity to work my butt off,&quot; she grins. 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It wasn't until after 
        Bowen had spent a year in Florence, Italy, became fluent in Italian, and 
        returned to Brown for her senior year that she landed the leading role 
        in an independent film, &quot;Five Spot Jewel.&quot; Though she'd grown 
        up putting on plays in the basement with her sisters in Baltimore, MD, 
        and even starred in Brown's productions of &quot;Guys and Dolls,&quot; 
        &quot;Stage Door&quot; and &quot;Lemon Sky,&quot; 'Jewel' would be the 
        consumation of Bowen's love of acting. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Somewhere in between 
        graduating from Brown and being named one of Detour magazine's &quot;30 
        Under 30&quot; to watch, Bowen get plenty of chances to hone her craft. 
        After earning professional stripes on a series of commercials, a recurring 
        role on the daytime drama &quot;Loving,&quot; and a guest starring role 
        on &quot;Class of '96,&quot; Bowen was cast in a film called &quot;No 
        Visible Bruises.&quot; The filmmaker, Ed Burns, would go on to independent 
        notoriety as the director of &quot;The Brothers McMullen&quot; and &quot;She's 
        The One.&quot; </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bowen </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        took her cue and moved to Los Angeles. Unlike the thousands of struggling 
        actors who take years to earn a little part, Bowen immediately landed 
        the lead in the Showtime movie &quot;Runaway Daughters.&quot; </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Adam Sandler would 
        become the unlikely leading man in Bowen's first major studio film, &quot;Happy 
        Gilmore.&quot; Was Sandler below Bowen's high-falutin' mind? &quot;He 
        is really funny,&quot; she says emphatically, &quot;And secretly one of 
        the smartest people I've ever met.&quot; </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> &quot;Multiplicity&quot; 
        would be Bowen's next move, (with Michael Keaton) preceeding a move back 
        to TV as a series regular on &quot;Extreme.&quot; More guest starring 
        roles followed, for the shows &quot;Party of Five&quot; and &quot;Strange 
        Luck.&quot; </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Showbiz works in 
        mysterious ways. After &quot;Multiplicity,&quot; Bowen dug into a tasty 
        acting challenge that would, as Bowen, says ruefully &quot;never see the 
        light of day.&quot; &quot;The Killing Club,&quot; a noir-ish story of 
        three women who go on a killing spree, is the project Bowen calls her 
        most artistically satisfying. &quot;I liked the idea, and the mental exploration 
        that went on when they killed somebody. Intellectual masturbation. &quot; 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Before finding a 
        possible home in &quot;Three,&quot; Bowen appeared in last summer's &quot;American 
        Werewolf in Paris.&quot; But &quot;Three&quot; definitely appeals to Bowen's 
        sensibilities. Of what attracted her to the role, Bowen reports, &quot;The 
        opportunity to get to be one of the boys on an action show, but without 
        having to sacrifice being a female. I definitely use my sexuality, but 
        I am equal terms with these guys. &quot; As for on-set relations, Bowen 
        expresses nothing but love for her cohorts. &quot;My castmates are very 
        funny. I am the dullard on that set. They are so much fun and very funny.&quot; 
        </font>
